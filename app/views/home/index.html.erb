					<h1>Why Pugs?</h1>
					<p>Hopefully to bring people together using sports.
Sports have always been a way for people to 
form bonds and get a decent exercise, but if 
you aren't on a team it can be hard to set up a 
game and by providing this service we aim to 
make finding and setting up those games easier 
for everyone.</p>
